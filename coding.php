  <h2>Prepared for An Audit?, The Coding Challenge</h2>
  <p>Our experience has shown that deploying certified coders on the front end of the billing process results in fewer denials by Medicare and Private Insurance Companies.   However, many medical professionals do not have certified coders on staff, because it is too costly, as they typically demand high salaries, or there is a shortage of certified coders in their area. While providers are trained in ICD-9 and CPT coding, these codes are frequently modified and the requirements to assign specific codes to encounters are changed.   Incorrectly assigning a diagnosis code or procedure code could result in decreased revenue (under coding), denied claims because the diagnosis and procedure do not match and over payment for services (over-coding) which in turn could lead to problems for the medical provider if CMS or private insurance companies audit their medical charts/records.</p>
