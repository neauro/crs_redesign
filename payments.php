  <h2>More Payment Options More Revenue</h2>
  <p><i>“Physicians typically collect only about 50% of outstanding patient balances, resulting in almost $60 billion in bad debt annually.”</i>  McKinsey & Company</p>

  <p>According to the AMA and several other recent studies, it’s getting harder and harder to collect money from patients.   What if you could increase patient satisfaction, reduce costs, get paid faster, collect more than 50% - and provide enhanced security for your patient’s billing information - all at the same time?</p>

  <p>FirstPaid is a web-based software system designed to calculate, process, and collect your patient’s payments quickly and cost-effectively. The application is HIPAA and PCI compliant and designed to simplify and accelerate the revenue cycle process. It contains everything you need to calculate the patient’s out-of-pocket costs, secure payment information, schedule payments, and automate recurring payment plans. The software is comprised of several distinct modules that when combined, offer one of the most intelligent and comprehensive patient payment solutions.</p>
