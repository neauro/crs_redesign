  "We are getting more of our hard earned money faster!
 After a year and a half of observing more and more of our hard earned
 money left on the table from rejected or miss-billed claims, we finally
 agreed that we needed help. Comprehensive Revenue Solutions came to our
 rescue. The cost of doing business with CRS more than makes up for what
 we were losing, and no more constant headaches! Tanya and her team are
 always coming to our rescue and her graciousness is always a bright spot
 in our day."

  Comprehensive Revenue Systems took over our billing in July 2009 when
 our situation was dire, with many unbilled claims that were about to
 expire and a variety of other problems.  Tanya worked tirelessly to
 bring us up to date, writing appeals, recreating claims and tracking
 payments.  Her remote access billing software is very efficient and
 user-friendly, providing us immediate information at our finger tips.
 We are now back on track financially, our patients feel supported and we
 know that we can count on Comprehensive Revenue Solutions for all of our
 Electronic Insurance Billing and Medical Records needs.</i></p>

    We have seen our accounts receivable go down and revenue increase.
 We were very fortunate to begin working with Comprehensive Revenue
 Solutions in May of 2009.  Since then we have seen our accounts
 receivable go down and our revenue increase significantly.    We have
 constant communication and get aging reports monthly and customized
 reports as needed.  I would recommend Comprehensive Revenue Solutions to
 any practice looking to improve their accounts receivable with an
 outside source.</i></p>
